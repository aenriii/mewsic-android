# mewsic Î²
next-generation feature-full music application

## notice
not only is this project not currently ready for use, but it is also important
to point out that this is very much a beta version, not many planned features
and optimizations have been implemented yet, and the code is not very clean.

this was made despite my personal reservations against single-platform code
due to the fact that the planned multiplatform implementations of not only
features but also rust-based optimizations and libraries are not yet ready
and will not be for the foreseeable future.
